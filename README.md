# Computational Intelligence
A multilevel perceptron (MLP)-based classifier with two hidden layers with neurons having an activation function, A clustering program with M groups (M will be defined with the define command) based on the k-means algorithm and the LVQ algorithm for clustering
• Construct datasets for differents examples\
• Classification based on MLP\
• k-means and LVQ clustering implementation
